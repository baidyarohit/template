			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>	In conclusion, this paper discussed the importance of writing, reading, and research skills in the disciple of engineering.  It’s crucial that as young professionals, college students are given exposure to these skills, and are expected and required to practice them.  Though many of these skills are developed earlier on in middle and high schools perhaps, college is the time when they can be really perfected, practiced, and focused on with a specific disciple in mind.  College English departments should team up with the Engineering departments in order to facilitate classes starting freshman year, as these skills are crucial in the professional atmosphere and recent graduates will need to translate them from their academic careers to their professional careers.  </p>
