			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>Culture can be defined as the characteristics of a group of people. This can include food, religion, music, art, customs, traditions, beliefs, etc. In Outsourced, the main social issue is the difference of cultures between America and India and how Todd has a hard time adjusting to a new culture. Before Todd goes to India, he isn’t told anything about his new assignment. He isn’t given any information of where he will be going, whom he will be training, or where he will be living. Because of this, Todd experiences culture shock. This can be defined as the “degree of psychological adjustment experienced by the individual within a new society or the degree of psychological comfort and familiarity perceived within a new environment” (Crawley, 2013, p 89). Todd is thrown in a new and unfamiliar community and his transition does not go smooth. He received no prior cross-cultural training so he was very unfamiliar with what India would be like. Todd’s culture shock affects his adjustment in the place where he stays in India. his workplace, and his interactions with locals. He goes through the stages of disillusionment, frustration, and then culture shock. Near the end of the movie, we can see that he begins to adapt to the culture, however. After culture shock, he goes into a phase where he accepts the different culture. He also then begins to embrace it and participate in it.</p>
			<p>Another issue that can be seen in this film is of embracing diversity. The people of India have different cultures and traditions than Todd and so, he comes to meet people who are very different than himself. They are different in their race, their national origin, beliefs, socioeconomic status, etc. When he begins to interact with them, there is some miscommunication and conflict and frustration. But after he is forced to cooperate with them, there is a shift in Todd’s thinking. He becomes more open minded and accepting. For example, he follows a complete stranger (host family’s neighbor) to their underdeveloped home and eats dinner with his family, on the floor, with his hands- all while not being able to communicate with them. Some of the beliefs of the Indians he meets still don’t match with Todd’s, but he becomes more open to the different opinions. The boredom and loneliness that he felt before are gone. He becomes friendly with Asha,who tours him around. He wants to know more about India, and asks her questions and is curious. All of this shows us that Todd at the end of the movie, becomes more open minded and accepting. This is probably because he had the chance to experience a new culture.</p>
