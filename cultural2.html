			<h1>Background Analysis</h1>
			<p>Outsourced is a movie about a US employee who is sent to India to train Indian employees who work at a call center for an American brand. The movie is about how the guy struggles in India and how it is difficult for him to adjust in a different culture with people of different kinds of lifestyles and values. At the beginning of the movie, the company fires most of its employees and sends Todd, a manager in his department, to India. Todd’s mission is to train his Indian replacement, and when his task is accomplished, he’ll be able to return. When he arrives in India, Todd becomes very frustrated with the people he meets, the business ethic, and some of the culture norms. He tries to emphasize the pronunciation of his name but everyone still calls him “toad”. The heavy food gives him stomach problems, there is a big language barrier, and the ease of doing business in India all frustrates him. One day, he meets another foreigner, who tells Todd his story of how he adjusted to India. He tells him that once you stop resisting India, everything will get better.</p>
			<p>The pivotal moment of the movie happens when Todd returns from meeting the foreigner. His integration becomes a lot better to India. Todd tries to do this by participating in “Holi”, the festival of colors and enjoys himself. In the workplace, he tries to relate to his employees and create an open work culture, which makes the employees more comfortable in their call center environment and the minutes per incident (MPI) number decreases. At his host family’s home, he opens his mind about eating the food with his hand. He fails, but he tries again. His mentality can be seen to be changing to things that he wasn’t accepting of before. Everything is going better for Todd, who also begins a love affair with one of his coworkers in India, named Asha. When his boss comes to visit, he is impressed with Todd. But, he tells Todd that the business is being shifted to China now. So Todd, and all the Indian employees are fired. At the end of the movie, we can see Todd returning to America, and he stays in contact with Asha.</p>
