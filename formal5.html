			<h1>Technology</h1>
			<p>Furthermore, engineering is a field that utilizes a lot of jargon and technical language.  Many engineering specific terms do not make sense to people outside of the profession.  There are many technical manuals and handbooks for engineering majors that are required to be studied on a day-to-day basis.  In order to have their students succeed in doing such practical tasks in the workforce, institutions of this discipline share committed to teaching their students the functional literacy skills.  Basic reading skills are learned from the elementary school days- however, reading for engineering needs to be very detail focused.  It is important to always look up certain words and terms that are not familiar to you so that you can build upon your technical vocabulary.  Being an active reader is very important in order to properly process the research that many students are required to understand.  Questions should always be asked for things that are vague, or not easily understood, and questions should always be posed to the author in order to challenge the reader’s understanding of the work.  Though engineering is a very practical and hands on discipline, while in college, and in many upper level positions, reading will be an essential skill that needs to be developed.  </p>
			<p> It is known that many engineering students have problems with reading and writing, and at the early stages of their course work, solely focus on engineering concepts and theories.  With technology changing in the industry sometimes nearly every week, it’s important to keep in touch with the crucial communication skills needed to be able to communicate the worth of the technologies, how they’re used, and for what purpose.  Sometimes, they allow their spoken communication to overpower the written communication.  When analyzing the trade article titled “Engineering Good Writing”, it was found that in many organizations, people joke around that many professionals in technical field can’t even write coherent sentences if their lives depended on it, yet they are expected to produce understandable recommendations and reports for a living.  The article discusses what trainers should keep in mind when trying to teach skilled and intelligent technical people basic skills such as writing.  The article mentions, “In most technical fields, writing requirements are thrown in as an afterthought” (Fey).  As many schools have received complaints that engineering graduates can’t write, many have begin to recognize that writing should be a core part of the curriculum and have expanded their writing requirements.  A case example of this is the Institute of Technology at the University of Minnesota.  This school now requires engineering students to take freshman composition and an upper level course in technical writing, and also offers additional elective courses in the science of writing.  Many students don’t view writing as an essential skill for the workforce, or they view it as a painful duty.  In order to really have students change their mindset, professionals are advising schools to reiterate that writing, along with any other skill or sport, gets better with practice.  Some technical people have avoided writing all their lives, so it’s important to open the floor up for discussion, have them be more creative in their writing instead of just practical and also pay attention to the details such as sentence composition and grammar.  The article states “teaching technical people to write can be a particularly frustrating experience for some instructors.  Others, however, find it rewarding to discover techniques to get around these obstacles” (Fey).  Engineering majors come in with a mindset of only learning the hands-on material, and not starting from learning the basic skills needed to work in any profession.  Thus, it is important that both the English department and Engineering department team up in an institution in order to ensure that engineering students are following writing mechanics, the stages of writing, and are getting tips for writing in order to improve their writing skills for their profession.  This way, there are requirements established early on, and engineering majors are receiving a well rounded, more liberal arts type of education.  </p>

			<p>Furthermore, if companies can carry on this scheme in the sense of providing writing, and reading workshops, they would be able to better ensure that their employees have the necessary credentials to succeed and improve in their current position.  For example, the illustration on the side is from “ ”Engineering Good Writing”.  It suggests different one-day workshops that employers have implemented to improve the writing and reading skills of their employees.</p>
