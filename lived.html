		<p>Hi, let me begin by introducing my self. My name is Rohit, I am 20 years old and I am from Nepal. My major is Mechanical Engineering and I have a passion and love for cars. Now that you know a little about me, let me tell you more about the relationship I have with cars. This relationship dates back to me being 1 year old, when I received my first toy car. I’ve loved cars my entire life since then. The car I drive at the moment is a Volkswagen Jetta TDi. It’s a diesel engine 4 door 140bhp and 236 lbs/ft. It is very torque. Wait, why am I telling you this? Ok so here’s why, this is where my journey begins. I was 10 years old when I first drove a car. It didn't end up good but it sure as heck didn't scare me. At the age of 12, I came third place in the very first go kart race I took part in- this was the very first time I drove a go kart. I couldn't qualify because back then the older lot aged 18 and older came 1st and 2nd place. However, for a 12 year old child, I would say that I wasn't bad at all. I raced again at the age of 15 and this time I reached my goal of getting to semi finals. All these events made me more certain about what I want to do in my life: race. Now that I finally have a job, I’ve started saving money to purchase my very first rally car. By the end of this semester or the beginning of fall, I’ll hopefully have the money for the car plus the gadgets for the car as well.</p>
		<p>Racing is what I want to do with my life.  This field requires me to be knowledgeable about engines, cars, and their components.  Accordingly, I am studying Mechanical Engineering here at Michigan State University.  My major goes into depth about the mechanics and parts required to design, build and run an engine. Thus, my major is going to help me better my understanding of how cars work as it will teach me most of what is there to learn about cars and engines- something I’m very excited about.  During my sophomore year of college, I choose to take on an internship at Ford, back home in Nepal.  For a summer, I worked as a mechanic.  In my internship, I performed varies duties such as removing engine parts, basic servicing, air filter check up, fuel purity check up, AC check up and oil changes.  I also worked on a project during which I helped to take apart the engine of a “SsangYong Kyron” which is a Korean build vehicle.  I took apart the turbo, engine head, transmission, fan belt, and engine gasket of the vehicle while my friend, helped replace the parts and put the vehicle back together.  This experience further reinforced my major selection, as I had gotten a head start of doing the hands-on work that I would learn about soon in my college career.  Learning the in and outs of an engine was very fascinating to me and I knew this was something I took a particular interest in.  By the end of my undergraduate years, I will be well known and informed about engines and their parts and how they function with different bodies on it.  This will help me set up my own Rally Racing team and eventually a Formula One team. Formula One is one sport that I wish I can take part in before I die. Formula One is the most thrilling and exciting sports according to me in the world today. It’s a racing sport and the most exhilarating sport to watch as well. According to many drivers, it is more than just any other sport- it’s their way of living. Though I know that I can take part in Rally Racing and Off-road trips, Formula One is one of the most expensive and complicated sports out there.  To have a chance at competing once I’m older, I practice race driving at times in empty fields or empty streets back home. I practice drifting a lot, as well. I’m not necessarily good at it but I'm getting better day-by-day, trying to reach perfection by taking small steps. Hopefully by the end of this year I will have perfected it. </p>
		<p>Driving and cars have had a huge impact on my selection of course for college. My passion and love for cars has driven me literally to highs and lows of the auto industry. I've driven to test the off-road capabilities of India’s most sold 4x4s. I've been over hills, plains, riverbeds, forests, etc. With these expeditions and trips, I've learnt a lot about my cars and their capabilities. For example, I've learnt that taking a low profile sedan off-roading is not a smart thing to do. This was one of my greatest off-roading experience, which took place late last year.  Even though my friend and I drove through the entire trail last time with the sedan, I will not be taking that vehicle off-roading again.  My friend and I drove through one of the roughest terrains in Nepal. We drove up to a temple called Pulchowki in Kathmandu, since the roads until it were great. But after, we decided to drive off the hill through a forest, which as I recall, wasn't a smart decision. After an hour of driving we realized that it wasn't safe to keep driving but it wasn't safe to stop either. We chose to keep on driving. The 4x4 had a broken gearbox crown, it was low on diesel and the cross joint was at a point where it could have broken and come off the vehicle at any time. Turning around and going back meant giving up and I do not give up. In that moment, my friend was really scared and so was I. We drove through most of the terrain on neutral gear which if I think about it now, I feel was pretty stupid and dangerous. The rear tire of the vehicle had gone of the cliff a couple times which freaked us out to a point where we started to sweat and shout at each other. This obviously wasn't all fun. But when we got down by the riverbed, we had another issue to deal with. The 4x4 got stuck between two rocks. The riverbed had dried out so we could see where we were going but that did not help much. It took us 20 minutes to drive out of that riverbed which was as long as a cricket pitch. This trip was the third off-roading trip I've been on and the scariest one till date. Never have I come this close to injuring myself, or even death, before. The funny thing is- after crossing every risk zone during that experience, both my and friend and I would just laugh.  Coming so close to such a fatal incident, seeing my life flash right before my eyes briefly, gave me some sort of thrill.  This is the thrill I drive, race and life for. </p>
