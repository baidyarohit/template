		<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
		<p>A First-Year Writing course at MSU is geared to introduce incoming freshmen to the reading, writing and researching skills they’ll need in order to succeed in both their academic, and professional fields.   Its purpose is to revisit the skills and techniques that students were introduced to during their prior education, brush them up, and develop them further for a higher education setting.  Many of us have studied in different locations and with different styles growing up, so it’s important to consolidate them as we get older in order to enter the working world.  In this course, we have completed four major assignments including: the Lived Experienced project, the Cultural Analysis Project, Formal Research Project and Multimodal Remix Project.  Each of these major assignments required using writing skills for the purpose of personal reflection, action, and further inquiring a specific academic disciple.    They also required us to engage in reading; online sources, scholarly journals, print sources etc. and link our acquired reading knowledge to our writing in order to reflect and critically analyze.</p>
		<p>The first assignment, the Lived Experienced project, consisted of picking a technology that has impacted our choice of career discipline.  The assignment was presented in both a narrative form, along with displayed on a website.  This major assignment required us to identify an academic track we have for yourself, identify a piece of technology that has influenced us to choose the said field, and then describe our experiences with that technology.  For this assignment, it was important to engage with our audience, as they may not necessarily be too familiar with our chosen academic field and/or the technology.  It’s crucial that a strong relationship between the technology and academic field is clearly demonstrated or explained in order to construct a concise narrative for the audience.  This project required reflection moreover, than research, which was one major difference from the other major assignments in the course.  It was necessary that you are familiar with the discipline you chose to write about, as you had to connect it to a piece of technology.  </p>
		<p>The second assignment, the Cultural Analysis project, was one of my favorites.  This assignment required analyzing a cultural artifact in order to investigate a specific social issue and it’s impact on our society.  I liked this project specifically as I was able to choose a film, and then draw on my cultural experiences that I myself have experienced in order to highlight a social issue.  For this assignment, it’s important to choose a cultural artifact that can be analyzed in depth.  The cultural artifact then has to be linked well to a social issue.  This project needs to have a strong purpose, as that’s what will set the tone for the comparison of the artifact to the social issue.  It also needed to have a well thought out social issue that has different levels that can be discussed.  The social issue should be relevant to the present society and be important enough where it’s relatable for the audience.  </p>
		<p>The third assignment, the Research Project, was one assignment that was more demanding than the rest.  For this project, it was crucial to brush up on your research skills.  We were required to pick an academic discipline, and expand on how writing, reading and researching operate within the selected discipline.  Though it’s given that these skills are important in every disciple, they are sometimes skipped over.  It was important to look at various different research venues, such as scholarly journals, trade journals and conduct personal interviews.  The research portion of this assignment was extensive, as it was important to narrow down your research funnel appropriately.   For example, when starting to research regarding a disciple, key words should be used that are appropriate within the discipline in order to narrow down the amounts of articles generated by a database.  Such a process helps streamline the research, as well as finds quality articles that are directly relevant to the research topic.  The research also needed to solely focus on your academic field, as the project demanded you to only talk about writing, reading and researching in that specific field.  Once the research has been completed, personal interviews also need to be conducted.  It’s important to approach the selected interviewers professionally, let them know the purpose of the interviews, and invite them to help you with some answers.  After they are conducted, the integration of the interviews within the project also is important as it should continue to flow as one entity and the interviews should add positive thought and reemphasize the value of writing, reading and researching from professionals who practice it daily.  This project helps students understand the importance of these skills as they’re required to analyze various different streams within their academic disciple and it lets them know of the expectations placed upon them.  Different fields also demand different things; for example, journalism will put a more strong emphasis on researching and writing than maybe an art discipline, so it’s important to research your field in depth in order to not pursue it without understanding the expectations.  </p>
		<p>Lastly, the fourth major assignment was the Multimodal Remix Project.  This project is different from the other projects of the course, as it’s a group project.  There are a few options allowed with this project, all three which require either a video end result or a documentary advocating for a social issue or informing audience of a specific major.  I liked that this allowed us to collaborate with our team members.  For this project, you and your team members must pick a topic from one of your past projects in order to create a video or documentary advocating the particular social issue.  As it’s a 7-minute long documentary, the script and timeline of the piece needs to be thought out beforehand.  The target audience also needs to be identified, as the video will be targeting them, so it should be tailored towards the group.  The script should have a clear beginning, middle, and climax in order to introduce and illustrate the social issue appropriately.  Team cooperativeness is essential for this project, along with time management as there are various players involved in the success of this assignment.  With the video being long as well, there needs to be ample amount of various footage in order to captivate the target audience.  This is one of the more creative pieces, as you’re allowed to visually demonstrate a social issue. </p>
		<p>For a personal progress report, I believe I’ve shown improvement in my writing skills and research skills over the course of this semester.  Not having done extensive research, I enjoyed doing the annotated bibliography worksheet for the Research project, as I gained a lot of valuable information regarding the techniques of conducing specific research for a purpose.  Though I had worked with MLA formatting in high school, APA was something new to me.  I had a hard time understand the style’s requirements, and I’m pretty sure I didn’t accurately cite my sources in the beginning of the semester.  By being able to understand this different style of citing, I gained experience and exposure to another resource that I might have to use later, even after college.  The requirements given for all assignments in the course were well detailed, however, still allowed for flexibility in order to input personal creativity and ideas into the projects.  Across all four projects, there were common points of significance that needed to be followed.  For example, it was important that there be a clear purpose and strong voice present in all four major assignments.  The audience/target group needed to be identified and kept in mind when constructing the assignment, in order to understand who the piece was being written or made for.  After they were identified, it was important to tailor the project to the specific audience so that the piece would be more effective.  For certain assignments, comparisons and links between academic disciplines, technology, cultural artifacts etc. needed to be demonstrated in a very concise and clear fashion.  This required research if one was unfamiliar with how to link them to the overall theme of projects.  </p>
		<p>In conclusion, a first level writing course at Michigan State University intends to further develop on the writing and reading skills of incoming first year students.  For the writing and technology WRA, there are four major assignments assigned throughout the semester aimed to develop such skills, along with introducing university level research skills that will be needed in other higher-level courses.  I enjoyed my time in this WRA as I fortunately was able to choose one that was directly related to my academic field.  I would suggest an incoming student to try to identify a WRA course that they would take interest in, as that will make writing more fun for them, interesting, and they’d gain the most from it.  If they’re unable to do so, I suggest incoming students to still have fun with a writing course as it allows you to be creative in expressing yourself and helps you develop future building blocks needed in any discipline you go in to.  </p>
