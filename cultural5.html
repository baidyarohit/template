			<h1>Anticipated Results/Effects</h1>
			<p>The anticipated results of having a culture shock workshop would be better and proper integration of someone to a new culture. People visiting or relocating would be more aware of what to expect, and be more aware of different cultures and ethnicities. This would decrease the amount of culture shock (it won’t eliminate it because it is likely to still be experienced), loneliness, and ignorance to different areas of the world. A long term effect of this would be that people would become more open minded and accepting of different cultures, which would cause them to become more diverse in their thinking patterns.</p>
			<p1>Stereotypes arise because people are ignorant. For example, I may not have traveled to India, but I may have a stereotype that all Asians are really good at math. If more people are given the chance to travel, to meet people who are different than you, to embrace diversity, stereotypes can be eliminated. This way more people will be willing to consider different opinions, cultures and people. In the movie, Todd had stereotypes of India. However, I think that after the end of the movie, he knew more about India than what his stereotypes told him. He was able to have his own experiences. He was able to formulate his own thoughts from these experiences and didn’t need the stereotypes anymore.
