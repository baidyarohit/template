		<h3> 1st Blog</h3>
		<p>I’ve never been a good writer in my opinion.  In high school even, I didn’t get good grades in my English class when it came to writing essays or papers.  I know that though I have lots of ideas and can talk a lot in person, I find it hard to put my thoughts into words.  To write a little bit, it takes me a lot of thinking and a lot of time.  One of my goals from this course is to practice writing.  By having to take WRA, I’ll get a whole semester practice of writing, which I hope will help me become more familiar and make it easier for me to write.  Even in engineering, there are writing requirements so I want to be able to write efficiently, under pressure, and well.  A main problem is that I sometimes become very informal when it comes to writing.  I try to write on paper how I would talk.  So for example, I like to start my sentences with “but, then, that’s why…” etc.  My writing sometimes is very conversational which is not ideal in a professional setting because the writing style then needs to change.  This is something that I have a problem with.  I need to work on differentiating when I should write informally, and when I need to write more professionally with a structure.  Many times when I get essays back, the feedback I get is that my writing is decent but I’m not really writing effectively, or I’ll write a whole paragraph and not have a main purpose for it.  So one of my main goals with writing classes in college is to get a good amount of practice writing.  I know my writing won’t drastically change, but I hope that practice will help me become more comfortable with it at least. </p>
		<h3> 2nd Blog</h3>
		<p>In the ad “Chrysler Super Bowl Commercial”, the history of Detroit is portrayed through a two minute commercial.  The chief marketing officer of Chrysler chose a very strategic time to release the advertisement- during Super Bowl, the largest TV audience of the year.  The ad tries to show what Detroit is, from its hard working people, to many of its abandoned and vandalized buildings, as well as the art and music scenes.  The advertisement uses vivid, positive imagery of Detroit in order to appeal to the mass audience and to recreate a sense of unity and pride of the automotive capital.  There are different angles used to showcase different parts of Detroit, and it’s rich culture.  A lot of the “popular” places are shown, along with places that are more stereotypical and considered dangerous.  </p>
		<p>Throughout the video, there’s a voiceover present.  The strong presence of the voice is dramatic and to the audience, it portrays a sense of immense honor.  It gives an upbeat vibe to the short film, and the audience is able to connect with both the imagery, especially if they’ve been to Detroit and seen it, and the voice that’s talking to them.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, the tagline “Imported from Detroit” is what has lifted Chrysler and its product line recently.  It’s fueling a corporate revival of the company that is now supporting Fiat as well.  As Detroit is the automotive capital, the tagline brings the advertisement full circle as it continuous to play on the pride and history of the city.  “Imported is a regular word thrown around now with our global world, and the “Detroit” part showcases the local talent and beauty present in Detroit and suggests that there’s no need for any foreign investment or product, because it’s all present nearby. </p>
		<p>The theme of the riveting advertisement is of pride, however, the advertisement also makes sure to portray the grim images of Detroit in order to realistically showcase the highs and lows of the city.  The theme of the advertisement is to portray a once proud and booming city, with a strong history of industry that hopes for a better future.  </p>
		<h3> 3rd Blog</h3>
		<p>In this episode, the online gaming world is depicted.  In the episode, Cartman, Kyle, Stan and Kenny are playing an online video game.  A higher player of the game doesn’t follow the rules and goes around killing everyone, so the boys dedicate their lives to saving the World of Warcraft. </p>
		<p>The group of people targeted in the video are video gamers, as the episode deals with online gaming.  The social issue in this episode is of technology.  The boys devote their lives in order to defeat the higher-level player, by deciding to play the game every single day.  Because of this, they begin to loose social interaction and are completely focused and addicted to the video game.  They devote all their days, and begin to neglect other activities, and become too focused to the point where it’s unhealthy.  This depicts this modern age’s technology social issue.  Many youngsters especially are so engrossed in technology in general, that it becomes an unhealthy obsession at times. They begin to live in an imaginary world, instead of living in the moment of the real world.  </p>
		<p>The view of the creators’ on the social issue is a negative one.  They are criticizing the youth in the Southpark video, as they’re unhealthily obsessed with defeating the player and by doing this, they’re only focusing on the video game.  The first thing they want to do always, is talk about it and play it as soon as they go home.  Though they are communicating with each other, it’s all related to the game, and all their interactions are limited and focused solely on that. Because of the way the creator’s have portrayed their behaviors, we can tell that they are criticizing and looking down upon the social issue and bringing the negatives of it to light to the audience members.  </p>  
		<h3> 4th Blog</h3>
		<p>For this project, I’m supposed to pick a piece of technology that has influenced me in choosing Mechanical Engineering.  I didn’t have to think too much for this, because I knew the obvious answer would be cars.  I’ve always been obsessed with cars even since I was a little boy.  They’re the reason I decided to pursue a degree in engineering in the first place.  Being a boy, many people consider this stereotypical.  I’ve always been fortunate that I was around different kinds of cars, and took an interest in them at an early age.  Ever since then I’ve been a “grease” monkey, and know the mechanics and how cars work.  Because of my passion, it just made sense for me to pursue a field that would allow me to continue learning about them and working with them.  </p>
		<p>What I found hard about this project was properly conveying how they had influenced me into words.  Though I know that they’re the reason I am doing engineering, I didn’t know how to elaborate on it more than “I have a big passion for cars”.  That’s what I’ve always told people, so I had a hard time digging deep within myself searching for a deeper reason behind it.  </p>
		<p>After I was able to articulate how the technology relates to what I wanted to study, the rest of the paper was easy.  I made sure I came up with a few main ideas, and that helped me organize it.  I liked this first assignment because it helped ease me into the course, as writing about cars was something very effortless for me.</p>
		<h3> 5th Blog</h3
		<p>Yesterday I turned in the cultural analysis proposal drafting activity.  As this paper was longer than our first Lived experience project one, I think the purpose of this activity was for us to construct a skeleton for our cultural analysis paper so that we don’t just wing something last minute.  We had to write a statement of purpose, write out the cultural artifact we were going to use and what social issue we wanted to address.  By doing this activity, I had already written down most of my cultural analysis paper’s main points, and the outline of the paper was completed.  I just had to expand on it in order to write the actual assignment.</p>
		<p>	A thing I think I struggle with when it comes to writing is understanding my audience.  When I have to do such assignments that want me to write the purpose for what I’m doing, it takes me a long time because I’m not consciously thinking about the purpose.  Though there always is one, I just write to write, without tailoring my writing to the purpose it should serve, it’s affect, or a target audience.  For example, I still don’t really know how to identify the target audience for my “Outsourced” analysis for this paper.  I don’t really know how to pinpoint a specific group, because I’m not writing a persuasive paper in which I have to know my audience well.  I’m hoping that the more experience I get with writing, the easier it becomes to judge what kind of audience you’ll be receiving and targeting and then making your paper have an affect on them specifically.</p>
		<h3> 6th Blog</h3>
		<p>I just finished watching Outsourced.  The movie was about a man whose department gets outsourced to India, and he’s required to travel as an expatriate to help the Indian employees set up their call center.  I liked this project because I was able to really connect with it as I was able to talk about my culture, and history.  Being Nepali, I’ve lived in India for a couple of years, and my mom’s heritage is connected back to Jaipur.  It was fun for me to watch this movie since I was able to relate to both sides- the Indians’ as well as Tom’s, the expatriate after I’ve lived in America for 3 years now.</p>
		<p>We had to come up with a social issue, which was also easy to do because the movie clearly plays on the stereotypes foreigners have of India.  There is a lot of miscommunication in the movie, lots of funny scenes, and lots of times when Tom accidently insults the Indian culture just because he isn’t culturally aware.  This was also one of the easier projects for me because I have such a strong background on the topic, so it was easy for me to write about it and connect it to the social issue.  I personally also have struggled with a few of the stereotypes.  When I first came to America, I was stereotyped as being really smart in math and my accent was ridiculed at times, so I was able to relate to Tom who travels to India and he faces such criticism.  By having been on both sides, it was easier for me to write about both sides in the paper as I had a personal connection with them as well.  </p>
		<h3> 7th Blog</h3>
		<p>I just finished the annotated bibliography.  This was a worksheet we had to complete that is going to help us for the research project we have to write regarding how writing, reading and research is relevant in our academic course.  </p>
		<p>Though this worksheet was a hassle to complete because it had many intricate requirements, it helped me narrow down my search for my research paper I think.  In the worksheet, we had to research scholarly sources that would be relevant to our research project.  We had to use words that we think would yield us with good articles, and then write down the number of “hits” or articles our inputted phrase yielded us on the database or search engine.  After this, we had to think of ways to narrow down the search or make our input words more specific to our major so that we would yield only a few articles, that were hopefully more relevant and of better quality.  To do this, I tried using specific engineering jargon.  But when I used too specific terms, then my search didn’t come back effective, so I had to find a good balance of being specific enough, but not overly specific with my words.  In the end, I think the research the worksheet required me to complete will help me better time manage writing my actual paper as I now have my sources in line.  I have done the bulk of the research, so now I just need to read my sources, analyze them, and use the information in the research paper.  </p>
		<h3> 8th Blog</h3>
		<p>For this project, I’ve done a lot of research.  I don’t think I’ve ever done too many extensive research projects in either high school or college, and this one was a first.  This was a harder research project in the terms that the research had to be very narrow streamed.  I had to research how writing, reading and research were important to mechanical engineering majors.  Though I know that it’s important, it was required that we have scholarly articles and trade journals on the topic.  At first, I had a hard time putting in the write words in the search engine to yield specific enough articles.  I finally refined my search enough to get a few good articles that pertained to the topic.  </p>
		<p>My favorite part about this project was the interaction I was required to have with professionals in my field, as well as a professor.  For the professional, I chose to interview Dharmesh Arora.  I had never talked to him on a professional level, so it was different to approach the conversation professionally and with an academic end goal in mind.  I made sure I had drafted out questions for both him, and my engineering professor before hand, and I asked them both.  I had to interview Mr. Arora over the phone because he lives in India, which was harder because we had some communication difficulties, but his information and input helped strengthen my argument of my paper since my sources didn’t help me too much.  My professor helped me understand the importance of these things in relation to my major here at MSU, which I think better mentally prepared me for my higher level engineering courses that I’ll begin to take starting next year.</p>
		<p>	What I found the hardest about this paper was the word requirement.  I think after a certain number of pages, I would run out of ideas or points to elaborate on and start repeating the same old ones.  Because of this, every time I tried to edit the paper I thought it was very repetitive.  I spent a lot of time editing this one just because I had to spend time getting my thoughts organized.  I tried not saying three ideas in one sentence, and tried spacing my ideas out and elaborating on them more.  My interview helped me as I integrated a lot of the interview questions in different places, and then used different things from my sources.  The paper definitely has better prepared me for more extensive research papers as it’s helped me write for longer word counts, with the same thoughts I had when I was trying to write a shorter paper, and helped me gain valuable research skills with the databases at MSU library.  </p>
		<h3> 9th Blog</h3>
		<p>For the research project, we had to interview two people and I already said in another blog entry that I interviewed Dharmesh Arora, CEO of Schaeffler in India and a professor of mine in the engineering department here at MSU.  </p>
		<p>I guess I hadn’t realized the importance of writing and reading in engineering, to be honest.  As I had wanted to pursue the major due to my interest in cars majorly, and I thought that I would be able to learn more about them and work with them if I went into the field, I hadn’t really thought about the all-rounded aspects of the discipline.  After interviewing my professor, they let me know how much writing and reading is important in engineering while I’m at MSU.  It’s important in my coursework, as I’ll have to do many research projects and lab reports.  This will require research, reading other lab reports and sources, and then writing my own results and finding.  It’s important in order to properly communicate your results to get a good grade.  When I talked to Dharmesh Arora, he mentioned how much of writing is crucial in every level of the engineering process, as well as any level of your job including entry level, manager, supervisor or especially management.  He walked me through a life in the day of him, and he mostly has to read he said.  As CEO, he started as an engineering major and worked with GM for a couple years.  But now, in upper management, he is required to read the reports and emails of his colleagues and bosses and reply to them in a proper manner.  In order to do this, he has to be knowledgeable on the items, and if he isn’t, he has to conduct the necessary research in order to communicate well.  He needs to know the places where he can find the information he needs/needs to know where to research as well as how to research efficiently as he can’t spend the majority of his time doing it.  Other than that, he has to write his own reports and findings, and communicate key business strategies and new ideas with his colleagues, team and bosses.  All of the processes of his job require him to do all three of those things, so that really brought that to my attention.  I always thought engineering was a very technical field, and it is if you’re in the entry-level position more.  However, the higher you get up in the business, it’s important to have communication skills because it’s crucial to communicate with each and everyone at work in order to successfully run the business. </p>

		<p>This proposal was hard to do because had so many different opinions trying to write one proposal.  I liked that we all had our own individual part to write for it.  This was good for our individual grades, but when we had to integrate all our parts into the proposal, our writing styles were different, our goals were different and the themes of our writing were all a little different so it was hard to conduct the proposal.  Apart from that, we had a hard time coming up with the specific details that the proposal wanted.  A lot of us wanted to just get together and do the project one day, so it was hard when we were asked to plan it weeks ahead of time.  We tried our best to think ahead of time and plan our project accordingly, but it was hard when we had just thought of the topic we would do the project on.  This also got frustrating for me personally because we would try to think of ideas, but because there were 3 other ideas from people, we had a hard time coming to a consensus.  But in the end, we were able to pull through and finish the project.  We don’t really know how well we will be able to stick to it when we actually do our project, because we know that once we actually start, we’ll come up with different ideas or themes.  Because of that, we know that the proposal is pretty tentative and we’re left open space within it to amend things, and add new scenes.  </p>

		<p>In the process of working on the multimedia remix project, I’m having some major drawbacks.  The video is supposed to be at least seven minutes long and after working on it for 2 hours, I’m only still able to get a minute and a half.  I’m running out of places to look for videos.  My goal for this documentary is to make it fun and interesting so that my classmates and other spectators have a fun time watching it, while getting educated on the social topic at the same time.  Because of that, I don’t want to only have my video be of the interviews my team members conducted.  A lot of the interviews are also of the same questions and same topics, so it gets too redundant to have them all be included within a seven-minute video.  </p>
		<p>I’m finding most of my video clips from movies or other videos from YouTube and converting them and downloading them.  I’m trying to think of videos that would be fun and relatable- so funny videos that our generation has probably seen already.  I’m also using iMovie as I get to play around with the software and use many modern day effects and tricks, and it makes the video a lot more presentable.  I can draw things within the video, add clips, edit them, add sound effects and I think this all will help make the documentary not as “boring”.  Though it’s hard coming up with seven minutes, I think I’ll be the most proud of this project as I think I did a lot of the contribution from my team.  This topic is very personal for me so I want to spend the time to make this an educational short film that will teach my peers a little about using technology when driving.  </p>
		<h3> 12th Blog</h3>
		<p>I am not fan of group projects just because I’m not a patient person, so this was a very hard project to execute for me personally.  I liked that we all had individual parts that we had to contribute and were graded on individually, but the group video part was hard to coordinate for our group.  We all have busy schedules, and we procrastinated on it so much.  I was the one who was putting together the entire video, which was a very lengthy process.  I had to find clips on the Internet that I wanted to use, and edit the videos my teammates had recorded.  A hard part was that a lot of the material they gave me was the same.  We had not discussed what specifically we would each ask the people we would interview, so because this wasn’t communicated, a lot of my team members asked the same questions.  The night I was putting the project together and was watching the videos, I realized this.  This put us at a major drawback because I had to find substitute clips, as I couldn’t use 4 clips with the same information unfortunately.  </p>
		<p>The issue though, was something that was very special for me.  There are a lot of close people in my life that are always texting when they’re driving or when they’re talking to people, and I’m not that kind of person.  Because of this, the issue is very close to my heart and I’m very passionate about it.  That’s why I was excited to help educate my peers about it.  I think it’s very wrong to focus on technology when you’re talking to people and many of us forget what it’s like to live in the moment.  Because we all were able to relate to the project, doing it was more fun. </p>
		<h3> 13th Blog</h3>
		<p>This project probably took me the longest to do because the guidelines were so vague.  Though that is good sometimes and I do like having space to be more creative, I sometimes need more structure and guidance with some assignments when I’m not sure what is expected of me.  I’m not one to really analyze my writing, so doing a progress report on all the papers I’ve written this semester was hard for me to do.  I had the most difficulty starting it, because I had no idea how or what I should write about at first.</p>
		<p>I finally decided to go down every major project or paper we have written and reflect back on it.  I basically worded it so that if incoming freshmen would read the paper, they would get an idea of each assignment as I wrote a brief summary and what is expected of them with each one.  I then also reflected on my writing, about what I thought I had done better and what I could have done better and what I’m taking away from this class.  I think the class was good for me personally because I decided to take a writing class that was related to my major, so I was more interested in it.  I also in my retrospective paper suggested incoming students to do that so that way, writing isn’t more of a hassle, but they’re enjoying it and hopefully gaining valuable information out of it that will help them later with their field of choice.  </p>
		<h3> 14th Blog</h3>
		<p>We’ve had our peers review a few of our papers in this class.  A lot of the papers have rough drafts due the week before the final draft is due.  I think this is a good idea to have your peers look over your papers, as they’ll provide fresh insight and a new view for your ideas, and also be able to criticize things that can be changed or improved.  I liked getting my papers peer reviewed but it was hard because a lot of the feedback I got wasn’t too helpful for me.  I think we are sometimes too preoccupied with our own papers that having to give others advice becomes another chore for us so many of students don’t take it too seriously.  Because of this, a lot of my feedback was very basic and it was more like my peers corrected my grammar and writing skills, rather than content.  Though I appreciate that, I would have liked some of my actual writing critiqued so I know what was affective and what wasn’t.  When I tried to give peer reviews for other students, I tried my best to give them good feedback that would help them improve their papers and would be useful.  However, this was hard for me to do also because at many times, I didn’t know the topic enough in depth where I could offer insightful feedback.  I tried to, but I didn’t want to say something that was wrong.  So I think there should perhaps be a better peer review process in place.  There needs to be incentive for us all to edit each others papers, because when there isn’t, a lot of us get lazy and don’t want to do it in addition to writing our own papers.</p>
		<h3> 15th Blog</h3>
		<p>After turning in all the assignments for this class, I can say that though it was hard to take a writing class, I enjoyed this semester.  As the class was hybrid, it was hard for me to sometimes keep on track with what is due when, and some assignments were not as explicitly explained due to the class being online, so there was a communication barrier.  In order to overcome the barrier, I made sure to communicate with some people in my class and always ask in class if I had any doubts on when assignments were due.</p>
		<p>I also had a hard time time managing some of my assignments because I put things off for the last minute.  I think the quality of my assignments could have definitely been better if I had decided to start working before hand, and planning my papers.  Some of the assignments were better quality because we had to do proposals or drafts for them and turn them in. This prompted and made me work on them before hand, and come up with parts of the papers or main ideas before hand, so it was easier to write the actual paper.  </p>
		<p>I think I was really smart with choosing a WRA that was of interest to me.  Being an engineering major, when I saw a WRA offered on science and technology, I thought it would be the best fit, and I think it was.  Having a course that I could relate what I’m studying to, made both the writing portion easier, and I also gained valuable information regarding what is expected of myself in my discipline as I continue on with my higher education and secure employment.  Though I mentioned this in my final project, I advise income freshman to try to keep this strategy in mind, so that a writing class isn’t too much of a hassle for them in addition to their normal course work.  </p>
