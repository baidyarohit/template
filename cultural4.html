			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>After watching this film, I think there are a few solutions to the culture shock that Todd experiences. When Todd is told that he will be traveling to India, he had some stereotypes of what to expect. For example, an image of elephants was what Todd initially thought off. It’s hard for one who is accustomed to one way of live to suddenly be thrown into another culture and be expected to adjust quickly. I think it’s necessary to host culture shock workshops before leaving one culture for another. In these workshops, the person would be educated on what to expect when traveling to the new country. They could learn about the new countries culture, religion, food, customs and traditions. They could even take some basic language classes or watch some of their movies. This would help ease the transition of someone moving, or even visiting another country.</p>
			<p>In order to be more open minded, I think it is necessary to put yourself in situations where you are not comfortable. Put yourself outside of your “comfort zone”. According to University of Alabama’s counseling center, expanding the intellect and experiences is important; you should learn about the variety of human experiences and then use it to enrich your own life and give productive voice to your opinions.</p>
