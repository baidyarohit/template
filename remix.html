		<h2>Memo</h2>
		<h3>Composing in Context</h3>
		<p>We chose to work on cellphones/smartphones and their effects on society. We discussed on topics such as- is it taking over our lives and is it causing us more harm than benefits?  The issue affected how we composed our project as the issue dealt with modern day technology and youth.  Because of our target audience, we decided to make a visual, stimulating film with clips from other videos, sound effects, and visual affects in order to captivate the audience through our technology.  Composing for this issue helped me understand the affect of cellphones in depth, and how dangerous it is in our present day world.  The main problem was organizing and splitting work and getting things compiled in time, in my opinion. There were a lot of mishaps with the recording of the interviews being unable to understand and hear, so this posed as a problem especially to me since I was delegated the responsibility of putting the video together.  Also, the audience played a major part in the project as this was an audience-based topic and it affected our audience on a day-to-day basis.  We tried our best to incorporate the audience in our project by interviewing them, having clips related to the youth, and constructing a project that would be fun and interesting to watch.  </p>
		<h3>Process</h3>
		<p>We read through some of our projects in order to select our topic.  Cellphone usage and effect was the majority of our first choice, since it seemed to be the most relevant today, and all were able to relate to it.  The most challenging part of the project for me was to get everyone to meet up at a certain time and work on the project together.  With our schedules, it was hard to coordinate the project and delegate tasks.  In order to take a systematic approach, we first made a rough draft/proposal of what we would want the video to look like.  Then, we looked at some videos on YouTube, which helped us understand what we actually wanted our video’s take home message to be.  Once we were done with this we finalized on a few interview questions and we also narrowed down who and when we were going to interview people. Once we were done with the interviews, and records, we collaborated the data we collected and started to work on the video. </p>
		<h3>Research</h3>
		<p>YouTube was the most beneficial resource for our project. We spent most of our times looking at YouTube videos and some reviews on cnet, buzzfeed, Wikipedia, and other online databases that the younger, college aged generation is familiar with as that was our target audience.  Wikipedia was the least beneficial to us, whereas watching live videos was the most helpful, along with websites that helped us find images for our video. </p>
		<h3>Collaboration</h3>
		<p>In the group we separated the parts that had to be completed, such as who would do the recording, who would do the interviewing, and who would collaborate the data and create the video.  It was good to work in a group, since the majority of the assignments in this class have been individual, but things would have been different with more time in hand.  By being in a group, we got to bounce lots of ideas off of each other and share our own experiences when constructing the video.  We also were able to interview a range of people since we all know different people and have different friend circles.  </p> 
		<h3>Project Management</h3>
		<p>We could’ve planned the project better, in my opinion. The management part was not really looked into initially. As we got into the week during which the project was due, we realized we should have managed our time better beforehand so that the video could have been compiled sooner so that we had time to edit it, and make corrections or improvements.  If I were to do it again, I would record the MSU campus for one whole day from the Cata bus stop, the Union, the International Center, the Business college, the Law college, the Engineering college and a few other dorms and colleges to review the use of phones by people of different background, major, department etc. This would have helped me determine whom I would like to interview and what kinds of questions I would like to ask them. The videos from these places would also be a good starting and ending clip for the final video. The other things I would like to do differently would be interviewing in a more professional environment. I would like to interview someone by talking to them about their personal selves and then after creating a connection, ask them questions, which they would then answer honestly without a biased opinion. I would like to spend more time on the video creation part so the precision and accuracy of audio and video timing are at par with those created by professionals. </p>
		<h3>Documentary Design</h3>
		<p>The most effective part I think was the humor that was added to the video using audio clips and smaller video clips from movies such as Pulp Fiction, The Good, the bad and the ugly. The parts of the video where it shows what the benefits of having cellphones are I thought was very informational.  The drawback part I hope will get people to realize and think, along with accepting the fact that most of us unconsciously do use our phones in dangerous situations. Most of us text while we drive or even talk on the phone while driving. Selfies are the most common thing today and we all know that at one point of our driving trip, we either take a selfie or a picture of the drive or text someone.  The main idea was to make people realize that phones are good but excess of everything is bad. The design decisions made were made on the basis of what I would like to see if I watched a video and what would appeal to me and my friends.  We tried to gear it towards our specific target audience.  We started it out with a captivating few quick shots, and then added some humor into it so that the audience will be engaged in watching our interviews, which we decided to place at the end of the video.  </p>
