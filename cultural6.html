			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
			<p>In conclusion, in the movie Outsourced, the social issues of cultural shock and diversity are depicted. Todd is given the opportunity to travel to India to train employees in his department of selling novelty items through a call center. However, Todd is thrown in an unfamiliar environment that is very different from his home. He is forced to establish a new “home” for himself in India. At first, he has lots of trouble adjusting. He is not used to the language, food, customs or people of India. They do things differently- for example, in America, business is very regulated. But in India, times are very flexible. One day, there is a flood in the business place and no one is working because the water has to be removed in the call center. Or one day, wild cows enter into the call center and disturb the employees’. Things like this cause Todd frustration, and he experiences culture shock. However, once Todd lets his guard down and tries to accept his new “home”, he enjoys it. He participates in a cultural festival, and interacts more. He begins to embrace the different culture that India offers. He falls in love with Asha, and she helps him adjust better and explains the culture of India to Todd. Unfortunately, he is fired at the end of the movie and so, goes back to his original home. But Todd’s initial culture shock that he experiences in India ultimately transforms to him accepting and embracing the culture of India. He begins to embrace this social issue at the end of the movie.
