			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>In the movie Outsourced, an American employee’s department is outsourced overseas to India. Todd, the employee, is forced to travel to India to train his manager replacement. Without receiving any training prior to traveling, Todd goes to India. Once there, he is surprised to learn that he will be staying with a host family, not in a hotel; his office is in the middle of nowhere and it barely has functioning electricity, and other cultural norms. He always looks puzzled at the painting of the Hindu deity, “Lord Kali” that hangs in his temporary bedroom, he has a hard time learning to eat with his hands, and he is always taken advantage of when offering help to young, homeless kids. Later in the movie, Todd’s viewpoint changes. He begins to accept the culture of India. He seems to be more friendly and open. He understands what “Lord Shiva’s” painting means, and offers his blackberry to the little kid before he steals it. We see that he is becoming more open-minded. In the movie, the social issues of culture shock and embracing diversity can be seen. The movie shows many of the normal stereotypes that are associated with traveling to India and Indians. It shows how it is hard to adjust to a new culture, with the example of Todd. These issues are very important in our society today. With people thinking that our “world is flat”, it is important to be open and embracing different kinds of people and different cultures. Gaining exposure and having first hand experiences will help open up people’s viewpoints and make them more accepting, like Todd became.</p>
