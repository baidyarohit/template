			<h1>Communication</h1>
			<p>	Writing skills are crucial in any disciple one goes in to.  All four of the communication skills- listening, speaking, reading, and writing- play an important role as they provide us with the means to properly communicate in order to transfer information and knowledge.  They are very important in terms of advancement and building bridges to new opportunities.  Though engineering skills are the first priority, equal emphasis is often now placed on potential engineering employees so it important that they are conversant, both orally and written.  According to Pushpa Latha, an Assistant Professor of English, “written communication is vital for engineering students, since not only text, but also calculations, plots and figures which are to be communicated in documents such as lab reports, progress reports, user manuals and journal articles”.  An engineer who has well-developed written communication skills will be successful in his or her career.  Engineering is a field where you interact a lot with people.  You will have to communicate with your assembly line workers, coworkers, bosses, managers, technicians, vendors, customers, etc. Technicians and operators count on engineers to convey their thoughts, ideas, and instructions in a meaningful manner. Producing written documents in a clear and concise way is important, regardless of the language.  This profession is very diverse and since our world is very global, people who lack the writing skills, or people whose first language isn’t English, can sometimes miss out on opportunities and not reach their full potential at the professional level.</p>
			<p>	Written communication in engineering should cover all aspects of a particular subject, and should begin with a clearly defined statement of purpose.  Ms. Latha says that “each communication should include a concise statement of what, where, why and when, as well as provide a final summary statement for reviewing the content and conclusions”.  Writing skills are important in student analysis, understand, and finding solutions to problem.  Effective writing should be writing with a purpose and with a direction.  It can be descriptive, narrative, persuasive, expository or argumentative writing (Latha).  The important factors of mechanics to consider when trying writing effectively for engineering include good handwriting, spelling, punctuation, italics, capitalization, and jargon.  It is also crucial that the audience is considered when choosing an appropriate format and tone for the piece of writing, since there are many subcategories within the engineering umbrella.  A study was conducted that showed that engineers spend roughly 24% of their job related time writing, 23% reading technical and business material, 11% supervising the writing of others and 7% giving oral presentations.  Below is a visual representation of the data in a pie chart:</p>

			<p>When you sum up all these numbers, it is obvious that more than half of engineering work after the entry-level position is comprised of communication tasks.  One will spend a good deal of time reading technical material, analyzing it, and will be required to respond to it also.  As this is a large chuck of the job, college students who pursue a major in engineering should be taking the necessary steps in order to prepare themselves for a professional career that encompasses not only engineering, but also other essential communication skills.  After speaking with Dharmesh Arora, a professional who started in the field of engineering and now is higher up in management, this idea became more solidified.  Mr. Arora started his career working in Maruti, India where he was a simple assembly line worker at the age of 17. He stated that communication in general, was important at that stage of his career since just one person doesn’t directly affect assembly line.  He said “if I was unable to finish my part on time, or not be able to communicate that I need extra help, I would prevent the next person from being able to do his job, and the entire process would be at a halt”.  He said that it was important for him to learn the importance of communication that early on in his career, as it was the building blocks of what was to come.  From an assembly line worker, he changed organizations and went on to work as a project manager in General Motors.  This was the first time he was given a leadership position and was in charge of a small team.  As he was in charge of preparing reports for his senior team, he had to brush up on his writing and reading skills.  Mr. Arora said that “[he] was required to analyze the information [he] had asked my subordinates to gather for [him], and put them in a writing form that was presentable to upper management”.  Though he had the necessary English skills as he had attended an accredited high school and college in Bombay, he had to make sure his writing was professional enough and easily understandable to those who had not had a similar schooling than him.  The writing had to be clear in order to sell the concept, idea or proposal to coworkers, or bosses.  He said this was what he had to get used to, as he “needed to make sure his writing was standard, objective, and on par to his coworkers”.  From this position, he advanced on to becoming a Director in Thailand and Mexico, where he had to further adjust his writing skills to meet the needs of his new teams.  The higher up he got in management; he said “more was expected of me in terms of both writing, and giving presentations.  I couldn’t just get by with the simple reports I was used to.  I had to step it up and really analyze my information in order to make executive management decisions.  Though this was hard, my professional career had in a way prepared me for this moment as I had spent years doing the same thing in different positions”.  In all, while I talked to Mr. Arora and asked him to elaborate the type of communication he uses in his current job at Schaeffler in India, I learned that he started out with small communication tasks, but now is expected to read articles, reports, analytical every single day and then report back on them.  Writing and reading are a crucial part of his job, and he is very thankful that he had the opportunity to gradually build up his skills in both those areas.  After speaking with him and analyzing my scholarly article titled “Effective Writing Skills for Engineering Majors”, I believe it is important to realize that writing and reading instruction isn’t the sole responsibility of the English department in college.  Dr. Genik of the Engineering department at Michigan State University would also agree.  Dr. Genik, an academic specialist in undergraduate engineering, when asked about the topic, strongly asserted that writing is exceptional for engineers.  It helps in communication, which “is important for conducting research, sending emails, etc.” – even the most mundane tasks.  She brought up an important point in that there are “many different languages and units in engineering and writing and reading helps to understand the different ways things are written and conducted”.  If undergraduates develop the skill early on, their depth of understanding within the field will expand, and they’ll better understand complex situations.  After speaking to both these professionals in the field, it’s clear that the institution as a whole should be involved, and specific writing courses should be provided for engineering majors.</p>
