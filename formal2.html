			<h1>Introduction and Background Information</h1>
			<p>Engineering is commonly mistaken as a discipline that has to do with engines, or building things, or fixing things to the common public.  Students who choose engineering as their field of study in college sometimes think it is a glamorous field that has to do with cars.  But it is much more in-depth than what is always portrayed by mainstream media.  Engineering is a discipline that applies science and math knowledge in order to innovate.  It uses technology and knowledge to design, build, and use different mechanics and structures.  A big part of this does have to do with engines and cars- however, there is a lot more to engineering fields other than just that.  This following paper will help broaden studentsâ€™ perspectives of what it takes to thrive as an engineering major in college.  It will provide an introduction to the requirements of reading, writing, and conducting academic research in the discipline.</p>
