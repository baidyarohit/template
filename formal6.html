			<h1>Research</h1>
			<p>	Apart from the necessary communication skills required for this discipline, as mentioned before, engineering is concerned largely with innovation.  According to Anne Chaker from the Wall Street Journal, “engineering is more problem solving and design challenges that deal with the real world, instead of theory”.  There is a big emphasis on academic research and research in the professional field, conducted by professionals who practice.  According to Dr. Genik, “research is exposure” and helps broaden the understanding of engineering concepts and principles.  Research done in the field seeks to improve the existing theory, and the major contributors to the research are governments, private business and academia.  Their findings are often published in journal articles, academic conferences, and displayed via new products that emerge in the market place.  </p>
			<p>An article titled “Academic engineering research in the United States: Characteristics and trends” discusses the major characteristics of engineering research in U.S. Universities, and identifies trends over time in these characteristics.  One significant trend that was found after two large scale national surveys were conducted is that there are an increasing number of units and institutions in which academic engineering research is being conducted.  The venues are attractive because they provide the opportunity to conduct certain research activities and attract funding facilities.  The second significant trend that is discussed is that there is a large move towards team-oriented research in the field.  Instead of seeing more research conducted by individual facility members, there is more research being conducted that is industry-oriented.  Furthermore, there is a gap between research that can be classified as basic, and institutions that conduct research that is “more heavily engaged in applied research and development activities” (Kannankutty).  The federal government acts as a major research unit- however, it more so supports research that tends to be longer term and fundamental in nature than research supported by industry.  	</p>
			<p>After analyzing the segment of the article titled “The Role of Academic Research in Engineering Education”, it is clear that students are involved to a great extent in academic engineering research activities.  As an undergraduate student, there may not be many opportunities present to conduct research.  The primary goal of research as an undergraduate student is to assist others, namely professors, in research.  It was found that the extent of student involvement in research activities isn’t affected by the size of a research group.  So, for example, a particularly larger group of researchers would still be able to conduct the research a smaller group of student researchers was able to do. Graduate students are presented with many more opportunities to do research and are often viewed as much more “independent and associate researchers than technicians or general workers” (Kannankutty).  The article also mentions that research units involve students to a greater degree in their activities than do individual faculty, which again points to the fact that students are an important component in the conduct of academic engineering research.  Graduate students can choose to get into a variety of different fields of academic engineering research including nationally recognized institutions, research intensive institutions with substantial research programs, to smaller, less research intensive institutions with a limited variety in their research offerings.  Students should be aware that the kind of institution they choose to go to will affect the type of research activities they will be able to engage in.  Obviously institutions of higher research intensiveness will provide their students with greater opportunities to be involved in basic engineering research activities that are more long-term and in which students get to interact with other students like themselves.  Their research training “will be of a more theoretical and fundamental nature, and they can expect to be involved in research that is supported by the federal government” (Kannankutty).  Additionally, with such a large sized institutions, graduate students would be able to get involved in a broad variety of research activities, from fundamental research to industry-orientated research.  The importance of getting in to research as both an undergraduate and graduate engineering student is that they provide you with the hands on technical skills needed to succeed in the field.  The skills that will be gained will be applicable and practical in nature, and a good supplement to the theory that they are learning alongside in the classroom.  </p>
